# genshin-impact-gacha-analysis

Genshin Impact is an open world RPG game with a gacha system, where players have to spend in-game currency to obtain random characters and weapons. This project aims to simulate Genshin Impact's gacha system, and determine and visualize the chances of obtaining 5-star characters and their constellations, as well as determine how costly it can be to obtain characters and constellations.
